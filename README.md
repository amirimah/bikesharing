# bikesharing
## Overview of the statistical analysis
The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
## Results
The following link shows the results for this project. Additionally, graphs are presented here for convenience.

The following graph shows the checkout times for users. In this graph, there is a peak in the first 10 minutes for bike checkouts.

The following graph shows the checkout times for users based on gender. In this graph, there is a peak in the first 10 minutes for bike checkouts for men (about 110k bikes), followed by women (about 35k bikes).

The following graphs, show trips by weekday per hour and it shows that there is a peak for bikes at around 8am and from 5-6pm. The breakdown of bike stoptime based on gender can also be seen. Men use more bikes than women and those with unknown gender. Additionally, during weekends, there is a peak between 12-5pm.

The last two graphs, show the hotspot locations for starting the bikesharing and ending bikesharing, respectively.

## Summary 
Based on the graphs, it can be concluded that the bikesharing idea is a solid business proposal in populated and busy areas, and the maintenance of bikes can be done after 1am where there is almost no demand for bikesharing.  
  
To better solidify the proposal, I think the whole analysis should be done for the months of June and July as well. Additionally, I would also look at bike accident data and create a chart for the locations with most accidents to see if the proposal is still valid or not.
